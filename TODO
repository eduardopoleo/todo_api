Probably I want an api that looks this this. It's always from the point of view of the user

list = user.create_list(name: )
task = user.create_task(name: , list: list_object)



Add constrains on 
- list
  - user_id
- task
  - user_id
  - list_id

Add groups concept

Think about a graphical interface. E,g 
list.tasks

list.completed_tasks
list.oustanding_tasks

user.outstanding_tasks
user.completed_tasks



User terminal-table
fg
